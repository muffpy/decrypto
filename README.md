<h1> Decrypto </h1>

A decryption scheme for Subset-sum encrypted passwords.

* Brute force solution - 
Every single possible combination of subset sum that could work as a result of running the encrypted password through the symbol table. This is really ineffecient as there are (32^C) million different combinations for a C-character password that only uses the lowercase alphabet and the numbers 0-C.

* Efficient solution -
Compute all subset sums generated by the first half, of every subset in the input file tables, using brute force and store the results in a hash table.
