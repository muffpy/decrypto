A decryption scheme for Subset-sum encrypted passwords

* Brute force method - 
Every single possible combination of subset sum that could work as a result of running the encrypted password through the symbol table. This is really ineffecient as there are (32^C) million different combinations for a C-character password that only uses the lowercase alphabet and the numbers 0-C.

* Efficient method -
Compute all subset sums generated by the first half, of every subset in the input file tables, using brute force and store the results in a hash table. For each of the N/2 first-half-sums, look up (in **expected** constant time) which stored second-half-sum adds with the first-half-sum to equal the encrypted code.
